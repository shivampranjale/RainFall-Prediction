Time Series Forecasting Projects

This project focuses on evaluating various models to develop a classification model for predicting rainfall. The project follows series of steps for arriving at the best performing model to predict whether it will rain or not based on various input features.

Data Source:
Data is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package

Steps Performed:
1. Data Exploration
2. Imbalance Check and Upsampling
3. Missing value check and imputation
4. Outlier detection and filtering
5. Correlation check
6. Feature Selection using Filter and Wrapper Method
7. Training different classification models
8. Model performance evaluation using roc_auc, cohen_kappa and accuracy metrics
9. Conclusion and closing remarks.
